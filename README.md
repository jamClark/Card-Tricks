# Card-Tricks
Custom tool for a short-lived Living Card Game project. It was designed for basic layouting of cards and rapid prototype printing services.

The basic premise was to allow for users to define sets of cards, place-holder templates that allowed for custom card design element layouts, and a rapid-print to 8.5x11 for quickly printing designs for gameplay testing without the need to export and import to an outside design program such as Photoshop or Illustrator.

After developing the smaller, purpose-built CardMaker app. This was a step up in complexity and purpose. With several people outside the project showing interest and even talk of a crowdfunding campaign, this was developed as a Proof-of-Concept application.

While many features that were present in the original project are not found here, several new features including a custom layout system for card designs, a much more robust serialization system, and an Attribute-based data tagging system that allowed for rapdily creating new design elements into the application via runtime-compiled code were all present in this project.

Unfortunately, the entire card game project lost focus and the team fell apart and thus this internally developed software went by the wayside. Regardless, it turned out to be a great learning experience for me with en emphasis on WPF application building, an in-depth dive into .Net serialization systems, and heavy use of the MVVM design pattern used by WPF.
